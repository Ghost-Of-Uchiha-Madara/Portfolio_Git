            <h3 class="project-title">Overview</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                "ZiggleWings" is a relaxing and engaging casual arcade game where players catch flying insects such as
                butterflies, bees, and dragonflies within a limited time. The game focuses on quick reactions, accuracy,
                and score optimization while maintaining a calm and enjoyable atmosphere.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Core Gameplay</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                Players must carefully observe insect movement patterns and tap or click at the right moment to catch
                them. Each successful catch rewards points, while missing too many insects or running out of lives ends
                the round. The game combines reflex-based gameplay with light strategy, as players decide which targets
                to prioritize for maximum score.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Game Mechanics</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                Different insects move with unique speeds and behaviors, creating dynamic and unpredictable gameplay.
                Players are given a limited number of lives and a time limit, encouraging focus and precision. Random
                task objectives add variation to each play session, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Progression & Challenge</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                As the game progresses, insect movement becomes faster and more complex, increasing the difficulty.
                Players must improve their timing, observation, and decision-making to achieve higher scores and survive
                longer sessions. The scoring system encourages replayability and skill improvement.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Visual & Experience</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                "ZiggleWings" delivers a calm and visually pleasant experience with smooth animations, soft colors, and
                satisfying feedback when catching insects. The relaxing atmosphere combined with light arcade challenge
                makes the game enjoyable for both casual and competitive players.
