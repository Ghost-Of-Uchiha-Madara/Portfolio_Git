            <h3 class="project-title">Overview:</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                "Space Shooter" is a fast-paced 2D arcade space combat game where players take control of a powerful
                spaceship and battle against waves of enemy ships in deep space. The objective is simple yet thrilling —
                survive, destroy enemies, and achieve the highest score possible while navigating through increasingly
                difficult attack patterns.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Core Gameplay</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                Players control a spaceship with smooth and responsive movement, allowing precise dodging and strategic
                positioning during intense combat. The ship can fire continuous projectiles to destroy incoming enemies,
                avoid collisions, and survive challenging enemy waves. As the game progresses, enemy speed, count, and
                attack complexity increase, creating a dynamic and engaging arcade experience.
            </p>
            <h3 class="project-title">Combat & Mechanics</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                The game focuses on simple yet satisfying shooting mechanics combined with fast reaction gameplay.
                Players must balance offense and defense — constantly firing while dodging enemy attacks. The smooth
                projectile system, hit detection, and responsive controls provide an enjoyable and polished combat feel.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Progression & Challenge</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                Difficulty gradually increases over time, introducing faster enemies, tighter attack patterns, and
                higher survival pressure. This keeps the gameplay exciting and encourages players to improve their
                reflexes and strategy. The score system motivates players to survive longer and beat their previous high
                scores.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Visual & Experience</h3>

            <p class="project-category">
                "Space Shooter" delivers a clean and visually engaging arcade experience with smooth animations,
                satisfying shooting feedback, and immersive space-themed visuals. The fast-paced action combined with
                responsive gameplay creates an addictive and replayable experience suitable for all players.
